		<p>	The ICC has a long term ambition to become the worldâ€™s favourite sport and our four year strategy that will take us through to 2019 is the first step on that journey. During this period we will <strong>lead</strong> the continued drive towards more competitive, entertaining and meaningful cricket for players and fans. We will <strong>grow</strong> the sport by creating more opportunities for more people and nations to enjoy it and increase the competitiveness of international cricket at all levels. We will <strong>promote</strong> cricket by delivering exciting and engaging global events, attracting new and diverse fans and building long-term successful commercial partnerships. And finally, we will continue to make considerable efforts to <strong>protect</strong> the integrity of the sport.</p>
